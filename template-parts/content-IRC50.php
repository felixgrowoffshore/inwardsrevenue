					<h2>IDENTITY</h2>
					<p>Identity is key to successful selling. Does the sales person consider himself a "trusted advisor" OR a "consultant" or just a salesman ? How truly comfortable are they doing what they are doing or are they just paying the bills? Are they congruent with the client and his tem at an identity level?</p>

					<h2>BELIEFS AND VALUES</h2>
					<p>It is a failure to understand the values of a candidate and a client that leads to so many failed hires. If one is driven to earn money and the other by client care then there is a mismatch. Our deliberate and consistent methodology unearths these possible pitfalls and reduces your risk.</p>

					<h2>CAPABILITY</h2>

				<h2>Why did we design the IRC 50?</h2>
				<p>We designed it because there's a lot more to hiring good sales people than matching a CV with a job spec or with making a list of competencies and ticking a some boxed in an interview. When you are hiring a people who are going to bring in the revenue we believe in getting right at the deepest possible levels.</p>
				<p>We interview both our clients and our candidates using IRC 50 so we can match the candidate and the cient across the 8 levels to ensure a congruyent fit of the your needs to the candidate and the candidates needs in equal measure.</p>
